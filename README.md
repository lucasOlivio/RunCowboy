# Run cowboy

Welcome to Run Cowboy!, an endless run game developed using Unity engine 2019 and C#. In this game, you play as a cowboy who must run with his gold to escape the outlaws. Your objective is to avoid the fences while collecting more gold to increase your high score. The game features intuitive touch controls and progressively increases in difficulty as you play.

## Getting Started

## Gameplay Instructions

The objective of Run cowboy is to survive as long as possible while collecting gold and avoiding fences. Follow these instructions to play the game:

- Touch and Hold: To control the cowboy, touch and hold your finger on the screen.

- Drag Left or Right: While holding your finger, drag it to the left or right to move the cowboy in the corresponding direction. Use this to avoid the fences that appear on the path.

- Collect Gold: As you run, collect the gold coins that appear on the track. Each coin you collect increases your high score.

- Avoid Fences: The main obstacle in the game is the fences. If the cowboy collides with a fence, the game ends.
